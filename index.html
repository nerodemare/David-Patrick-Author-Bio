        <p><strong><em>Health Insurance Recovery Solutions</em></strong> was conceived in 2021 to offer more devious services 
        to insurance carriers. Our god-fearing leader saw in a vision this compelling need to 
        help maximize funding for the healthcare industry, and he decided that outrageous premium 
        hikes were just not enough. This man realize that what he needed to do was launch a full 
        scale assault on injured people's injury settlements. Imagine both you and your health plan 
        paid a hospital bill for a serious auto collision that left you incapacitated and that you 
        consequently received a huge payout from the auto insurance carrier. Remember that gargantuan
        hospital bill that you - and your health insurance provider - already paid? Well, now you 
        get to reimburse your health plan from that settlement . . . when you awake from that coma. 
        </p>
        
        <p>And imagine how many people suffer injuries everyday and how many of them receive a 
        settlement with the other party. And guess what. We don't negotiate. No, we believe that you 
        owe every last penny from that settlement back to your health insurance carrier. It is this 
        forward thinking, assertive business model that makes <em>Health Insurance Recovery Solutions</em> 
        the largest and most successful company in the world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Will you hand over your settlement to us, nice and quietly, please? 
        <br>

<!--CSS Item No. 1: A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and 
    mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened 
    and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon-->

<!--JS Item No. 2 (use JS in a separate file): Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), 
    validate at least one field (ex: email is in the correct format) and then use that information 
    on your page somehow. For example, display it back to the user on button click, or change a 
    setting on the page based on a section. Having a form that does nothing on clicking Submit 
    or that just refreshes the page is not enough - you must capture the value(s) of the form and 
    use it somehow.-->

<!--CSS Item No. 3: Create your own original CSS animation. For example, create a loading spinner 
    or menu animation ( see https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_loader.asp )-->
